## Settnig up the project

Our raytracing system is developed in Julia, you'll need to set up the project environment. Start by cloning the repository, go the the WWURay directory, and run Julia with --project flag.
```
$ cd path/to/WWURay
$ julia --project
```
At the Julia prompt, press ] to switch to the pkg prompt and install the packagea dependencies for this project:
```
julia> ]
(WWURay) pkg> instantiate
```
Back to the julia prompt, type the commend to make our WWURay moduel accessible:
```
(WWURay) pkg> [backspace]
julia> using WWURay
```
Now, you are ready to try our raytracer.


## Rendering Scene Images 
We has three defaults scene for testing. Our main function to render a scene is like below:
```
julia> WWURay.main(scene, height, width, out)
    scene: scene number [1, 2, or 3]
    height: canvas height
    width: canvas width
    out: prefix for a set of images files
``` 

Once you run this, successive scenimages are generated by the position of camera moving under video folder. For example:
```
julia > WWURay.main(2, 1, height, width, "s3_")
```
```
$ cd video
$ ls
03/13/2020  05:24 PM    <DIR>          .
03/13/2020  01:37 PM    <DIR>          ..

...
```


## Creating Video From Scene Images
To create a video, we are using external multimedia framework called FFmpeg. More information is [here](https://hamelot.io/visualization/using-ffmpeg-to-convert-a-set-of-images-into-a-video/). For our default scene, you can run the below command.

```
$ ffmpeg -r 60 -f image2 -s 1920x1080 -i s2_%d.png -vcodec libx264 -crf 25  -pix_fmt yuv420p s2_video.mp4
```
