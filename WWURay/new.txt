Instructions:
Running this is very similar to running the Assignment 2 code.

We start up julia like before:
julia --project
using Revise
using WWURay

At this point, we call

Code guide:





scene 1 aerial:
function camera_portal1(img_height, img_width)
    eye = Vec3(7, 5, 7)
    view = Vec3(2, 0.5, 0) - eye
    up = Vec3(0, 1, 0)
    focal = 1.0
    Cameras.PerspectiveCamera(eye, view, up, focal, img_height, img_width)
end


scene 2 aerial: just add +5 to eye height

scene 3 aerial:
function camera_portal3(img_height, img_width)
	eye = Vec3(-6,6,3)
	view = Vec3(0,0.5,3) - eye
	up = Vec3(0,1,0)
	focal = 1.0
	Cameras.PerspectiveCamera(eye, view, up, focal, img_height, img_width)
end
