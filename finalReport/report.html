        <h2>2. Summary</h2>
        <p>
         We started out this final project fairly ambitious; aiming to provide user control and specifications for portal objects. By our milestone we realized this would not be possible in the timeframe we had, as well as
         the difficulty of actually implementing portals. Instead we decided at our milestone to animate scenes with portals present in them. While we were not able to achieve dynamic user interaction, we were able to successfully
         animate a couple of scenes with the valve portal effect. This project presented more challenges than we had originally thought and there are fairly few resources on portal raytacing. Overall, we mostly hit our milestone goals and learned a lot during this project. Scenes 1 and 4 are fully functional with portal implementation and scenes 2 and 3 demonstrate portal like effects using standard machinary.

        <h2>5. Coding guide</h2>
        The meat of our code is based heavily on our raytracer from A2. Given that we created a new portal object mesh which lives in OBJMeshes.jl and a user is able to specify both the x and y radius. We then modified the test scenes such that each portal would have a wall to rest on as well as a an orange or blue background. Also in TestScenes.jl we implemented a way to rotate points that can be used in a the mesh_helper function, as well as standalone use - which we used to change the
        camera position in order to generate an animation. In WWURay.jl we recalculated the mirror ray based on certain scenes. Note that we were unable to come up with a scalable way to render portals and did the math by hand to
        compute these viewing rays. Also in WWURay lays the driver code to generate 60 images, as to achieve 60 fps on a video.
